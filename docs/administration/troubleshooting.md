## Subfolder permissions

Web server runs in a different group than your user account on most servers. Following subfolder permissions will necessary to grant write access from GenIE-Sys.:
```
chgrp -R www-data geniesys
chmod -R 775 geniesys/genie_files
```
Please make sure that the root folder is also readable by the webserver.

## Broken subpages

Whenever you have problems(can not open or  a server error) with subpages, you can try following steps.
* Make sure that the .htaccess file is present inside GenIE-Sys folder.
* mod_rewrite should be enabled on your server.
* You need to check the .htaccess. You can test this by adding  some extra  characters into your .htaccess. If this cause an "Internal Server Error", the file gets loaded. Otherwise, you need to enable AllowOverride all in your Web server  configuration file. An example of ```GenIE-Sys/.htaccess``` file shown below.

```
RedirectMatch 403 ^.*/genie_files/
ErrorDocument 403 &nbsp;
RewriteEngine on
Options -Indexes
ServerSignature Off
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteCond $1#%{REQUEST_URI} ([^#]*)#(.*)\1$
RewriteRule ^([^\.]+)$ %2?page=$1 [QSA,L]
ErrorDocument 404 /notfound.html
```


Please make sure that you are using the PHP 5.4 or higher.
