Installation
=====================  


## Installing with MAMP/XAMPP
  
Most Mac users will probably try GenIECMS with MAMP/LAMP.

Installing MAMP is just a matter of downloading the app from the MAMP website and running the installer. It will install a MAMP app in your Applications folder.

By starting the MAMP app you are also starting your Apache and MySQL server. You should now be able to reach your local server at ```http://localhost:8888```.

It is convenient to change the MySQL and Apache ports to 3306 and 80 respectively to use default MySQL and Apache ports.

**Download GenIECMS**

**Copy GenIECMS to MAMP Web server**

You will find the source of GenIECMS in your download folder. So you just need to Copy GenIECMS folder into corresponding ```~/Applications/MAMP/htdocs/``` folder.

That is basically what you need to do in order to install GenIECMS on your Mac's local server. You should now be able to access it at: ```http://localhost:8888/GenIECMS``` in your browser.


## Docker installation 

For Developers and Contricutors

```
# Please comment the supporting_files/run.sh line to avoid download the geniecms.git  
git clone https://github.com/irusri/docker4geniecms.git  
cd docker4geniecms  
git submodule add -f https://github.com/irusri/genie.git  
docker build -t genie -f ./Dockerfile .  
docker run --rm -i -t -p "80:80" -p "3308:3306" -v ${PWD}/genie:/app -v ${PWD}/mysql:/var/lib/mysql -e MYSQL_ADMIN_PASS="mypass" --name genie genie  
cd genie 
```

When we need to commit changes, please go to `cd docker4geniecms/genie` folder. Never commit from `docker4geniecms` folder. Because it will add genie as a submodule. Incase you mistakenly pushed from `docker4geniecms` folder, please `cd docker4geniecms` and  `git rm genie`. You can access MySQL using `mysql -u admin -pmypass -h localhost -P 3308` or using [phpMyAdmin](http://localhost/phpmyadmin). Some useful docker commands are as follows.
```
# Must be run first because images are attached to containers
docker rm -f $(docker ps -a -q)
# Delete every Docker images
docker rmi -f $(docker images -q)
# To see docker process
docker ps -l 
# To see or remove all volumes
docker volume ls/prune
# To run bash inside the running docker container
docker exec -it 890fa15eeef6126b668f4b0fcb7a38b33eaff0 /bin/bash
or
docker attach 890fa15eeef6126b668f4b0fcb7a38b33eaff0
```

Now we can start the real development and push changes into genie.


## Running from Command Line

If you want to use PHP's built-in server (not recommended), just use following lines to install GenIECMS. This is only for the initial test installation, in order to make a full functional website you have to install Webbserver package such as MAMP or LAMP.

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/irusri/GenIECMS.git
cd GenIECMS
php -S localhost:3000
```
You should now be able to access GenIECMS at: ```http://localhost:3000``` in your browser.
