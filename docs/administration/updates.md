------------------------
Update configuration file
------------------------
We should update the settings file(```GenIECMS/plugins/settings.php```) right after the installtion. Especially the base URL depending on your webhost. For example:

```php
/*Define your base url with trailing slash*/
$GLOBALS["base_url"]='http://localhost:8888/GenIECMS/';

OR

$GLOBALS["base_url"]='http://localhost:3000';

```

Next, we need to create a MySQL database and load our data.

Troubleshooting
------------------------
GenIECMS can easily be installed without an effort. Unfortunately there is always space for problems due to multiple server setups and PHP versions. In this section, we try to answer most frequent issues in order to install GenIECMS as effortless as possible. Please send us an email if you still get trouble with installation or updates: ```contact@geniecms.org```

**Subfolder permissions**

Web server runs in a different group than your user account on most servers. Following subfolder permissions will necessary to grant write access from GenIECMS.:
```
chgrp -R www-data GenIECMS
chmod -R 775 GenIECMS/genie_files
```
Please make sure that the root folder is also readable by the webserver.

**Broken subpages**

Whenever you have problems(can not open or  a server error) with subpages, you can try following steps.
* Make sure that the .htaccess file is present inside GenIECMS folder.
* mod_rewrite should be enabled on your server.
* You need to check the .htaccess. You can test this by adding  some extra  characters into your .htaccess. If this cause an "Internal Server Error", the file gets loaded. Otherwise, you need to enable AllowOverride all in your Web server  configuration file. An example of ```GenIECMS/.htaccess``` file shown below.

```
RedirectMatch 403 ^.*/genie_files/
ErrorDocument 403 &nbsp;
RewriteEngine on
Options -Indexes
ServerSignature Off
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteCond $1#%{REQUEST_URI} ([^#]*)#(.*)\1$
RewriteRule ^([^\.]+)$ %2?page=$1 [QSA,L]
ErrorDocument 404 /notfound.html
```


Please make sure that you are using the PHP 5.4 or higher.
