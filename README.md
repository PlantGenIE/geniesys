Docker installation can be done in several ways.

**1.\) Run using Play with Docker**
The quickest way to test the GenIE-Sys, it takes only a few minutes

[![Try in PWD](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/play-with-docker/stacks/master/assets/images/button.png)](https://labs.play-with-docker.com/?stack=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irusri/docker4geniesys/master/pwd-stack.yml)

**2.\) Run with build in Docker image**                                                                          
The fastest way to run the GenIE-Sys locally or your own server
```text
docker run --rm -i -t -p "80:80" -p "3308:3306" -v ${PWD}/genie:/app -v ${PWD}/mysql:/var/lib/mysql -e MYSQL_ADMIN_PASS="mypass" --name geniesys irusri/docker4geniesys
```

**3.\) Build image locally using Dockerfile and run.**
This is quite slow since you have to build the image locally

```text
git clone https://github.com/irusri/docker4geniesys.git  
cd docker4geniesys  
docker-compose up
```

You can access MySQL database using `mysql -u admin -pmypass -h localhost -P 3308` or using [phpMyAdmin](http://localhost/phpmyadmin). Some useful docker commands are as follows. As you may noticed here `admin` is the default MySQL username and `mypass` is the default  password. You can change that in `docker-compose.yml file.`

üëç  GenIE-Sys is available on [http://localhost/geniesys/](http://localhost/geniesys/) URL and follow the  [documentation](https://app.gitbook.com/@geniesys/s/geniesys/for-administrators/installation).
